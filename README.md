# Wind Turbine + Air Particles Collision Simlulator

*This project has been created for CS 4392 (Computer Animation)*

## About

This project uses the Three.js 3D library to create a simulation of the rotation of a wind turbine and the energy generated based due air particles collision and their effect on the turbine. The movement of the wind turbine is completely dependent on the air particles and their collision with the turbine.
